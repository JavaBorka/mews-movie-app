## 🔐 Environment Variables

To configure the environment variables for this app, follow these steps:

1. Copy the example environment file to create your own local `.env` file:
`cp .env.example .env`

2. Open the newly created `.env` file and replace the placeholder value for the TMDb API key with your own key.
